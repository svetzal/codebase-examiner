# Codebase Examiner - Product Specification

## Problem Statement

Large codebases present a significant challenge for AI-powered coding systems due to the fundamental
limitation of context window size in Large Language Models (LLMs). Current LLMs typically have
context windows of 32K to 64K tokens, which is insufficient to encompass entire codebases of
meaningful size. This limitation leads to several critical issues:

1. **Incomplete Understanding**: AI agents cannot "see" the entire codebase at once, leading to
   incomplete understanding of system architecture and interdependencies.

2. **Navigation Challenges**: Without a comprehensive view, AI agents struggle to locate relevant
   code sections that need to be read or modified.

3. **Integration Difficulties**: Limited context makes it difficult for AI agents to understand how
   changes will integrate with and impact the broader system.

4. **Inefficient Token Usage**: Loading arbitrary code files consumes valuable context tokens that
   could be better utilized for reasoning and solution development.

5. **Attention Fading**: Even with larger context windows, LLMs experience "attention fading" where
   information at the edges of the context window receives less attention.

These limitations significantly reduce the effectiveness of AI agents when working with real-world
software projects, which often contain hundreds or thousands of files and complex interdependencies.

## How Might We Statement

**How might we provide AI agents with a concise yet comprehensive understanding of large codebases,
enabling them to efficiently navigate, modify, and reason about code despite context window
limitations?**

The Codebase Examiner addresses this challenge by creating structured, information-dense summaries
of Python codebases that:

1. Extract the essential structure and documentation of the codebase
2. Present this information in a format optimized for AI consumption
3. Enable AI agents to quickly locate relevant code sections for deeper examination
4. Provide sufficient context for understanding how components interact within the system

## Product Specifications

### Core Functionality

1. **Codebase Scanning**
    - Recursively identify all code files in a project directory
    - Automatically detect and respect .gitignore patterns for file exclusion
    - Exclude common non-source directories (.venv, .git, __pycache__, target, etc.) by default
    - Allow customization of directories to exclude
    - Support for including or excluding dotfiles

2. **Code Analysis**
    - Extract code structural definitions (eg module, class, and function in Python)
    - Parse documentation in code (eg docstrings in Python, Javadoc in Java)
    - Extract parameter information, including types, defaults, and descriptions
    - Extract return value information, including types and descriptions
    - Identify higher-scoped variables and constants like module attributes in Python

3. **Documentation Generation**
    - Generate structured documentation in Markdown format
        - Table of contents for easy navigation
        - Hierarchical organization (modules → classes → methods)
        - Parameter and return value details
    - Generate machine-readable documentation in JSON format
        - Complete representation of the codebase structure
        - Easily parseable by AI agents

4. **Deployment Options**
    - Command-line interface for direct use
    - MCP over HTTP for integration with web-based AI systems
    - MCP over STDIO for integration with AI agent frameworks

### User Experience

1. **Command-line Interface**
    - Simple, intuitive commands
    - Clear, formatted output
    - Progress indicators for large codebases
    - Configurable output format and location

2. **Server Interfaces**
    - RESTful API for MCP over HTTP
    - JSON-based communication protocol for MCP over STDIO
    - Consistent response format across interfaces

### Performance Requirements

1. **Scalability**
    - Handle codebases with hundreds of files
    - Process large files efficiently
    - Minimize memory usage

2. **Speed**
    - Generate documentation quickly enough for interactive use
    - Optimize parsing algorithms for large codebases

### Integration Capabilities

1. **AI Agent Integration**
    - Provide documentation in formats optimized for AI consumption
    - Support for programmatic querying of codebase structure
    - Enable AI agents to request specific information about code components

2. **Development Workflow Integration**
    - Generate documentation that can be included in project repositories
    - Support for CI/CD integration

## Success Metrics

The success of the Codebase Examiner will be measured by:

1. **Reduction in Context Window Usage**: How efficiently can AI agents understand and navigate
   codebases compared to loading raw source files?

2. **Navigation Efficiency**: How quickly can AI agents locate relevant code sections for a given
   task?

3. **Comprehension Accuracy**: How accurately do AI agents understand the structure and
   functionality of the codebase?

4. **Integration Quality**: How well do AI-implemented changes integrate with the existing codebase?

## Future Directions

1. **Multi-language Support**: Extend beyond Python to other programming languages

2. **Semantic Analysis**: Include more advanced code analysis, such as call graphs and data flow

3. **Differential Updates**: Support for analyzing only changed files since the last examination

4. **Interactive Querying**: Allow AI agents to ask specific questions about the codebase

5. **Visual Representations**: Generate visual diagrams of code structure and relationships
